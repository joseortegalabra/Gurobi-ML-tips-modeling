# Gurobi ML Tips
Repo that contains tips of modeling a optimization problem with machine learning models. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: All the examples follow one network used to create the optimization problem but each examples are individual each other and only represent an idea how to write differents constraints but not search the optimal value of the problem

### Example use case
The examples are created using the following network.
